dracopy
========
This repository contains the source code of the Commodore 64 copy program dracopy.
I have found two versions of the source code:
- 1.0c on https://csdb.dk/release/?id=89910
- 1.0e on https://c-128.freeforums.net/thread/568/new-drabrowse-copy-file-browser

The original program was written by Sascha Bader and is available at
http://www.mobilefx.de/html/dracopy.html
it currently has version 1.0d for download, but the source code is not available.

The 1.0e version was updated by an unknown developer.

source code
------------
The master branch is currently empty. Look at the branches

- 1.0c
- 1.0e

for source code of those versions. The code was tested to build on a unix system with GNU make.
